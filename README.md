# Sassify
A simple Atom package that parses pasted CSS-code into Sass by removing curly-braces, semicolons and auto-indenting.

### Why Sassify?
When working with Sass, you will often find yourself pasting CSS-code from Chrome Devtools, a friend/colleague or an open source repository. In the long term, removing all the semicolons and curly-braces can be exhausting though, and that's definetly something that should not keep you away from using Sass in a project. Sassify solves this by automaticly parsing all the CSS-code you paste into an Sass-project by removing semicolons, curly-braces, auto-indenting and changing comment prefix to `//` for example.
